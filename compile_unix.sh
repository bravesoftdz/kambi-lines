# We must do cd ../kambi_vrml_game_engine/ (and call FPC from that directory)

# This program uses GLWindow unit. GLWindow unit may be compiled
# with various back-ends (e.g. under Unices two most useful back-ends
# are XLIB and GTK). To make sure that compilation of this program
# will produce exactly what you need, below we make sure that
# unit GLWindow will be *always* *rebuild*.
#
# Of course this means that compilation time will suffer a little,
# since GLWindow unit will be possibly rebuild without any real need.
# Comment out line below if you want.
