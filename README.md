# kambi_lines

Clone of an old "Color lines" game. You need to arrange colored balls in lines, to make space on the board.

Concept is *very* closely based on an old DOS "Color lines" game by Olga Demin (programming), Igor Ivkin and Gennady Denisov (graphics). Credit for graphics goes to Igor Ivkin and Gennady Denisov, we merely use their graphics.
